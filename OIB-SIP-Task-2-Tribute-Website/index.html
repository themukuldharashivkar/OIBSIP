                <h2>About Virat Kohli</h2>
                <p>
                  Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and former captain of the
                  Indian national team. He is regarded as one of the best
                  batsmen in the world and has numerous records to his name.
                  Kohli is known for his aggressive style of play and his
                  ability to chase down targets in limited-overs cricket.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India. Kohli
                  started playing cricket at a young age and made his debut for
                  the Indian national team in 2008. Since then, he has gone on
                  to become one of the most successful cricketers in the world.

              <h3>Here's a time line of Virat Kohli's life:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>2002</strong> - In October, 13-year-old Virat is
                  called up to the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar
                  Trophy. He finishes the season as Delhi’s top scorer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2006</strong> - After impressing at the youth level
                  for Delhi, Virat is selected for the India Under-19 team for
                  the first time and has a glorious tour of England, averaging
                  over a hundred in the one-day series.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2008</strong> - Virat captained India to victory in
                  the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, finishing the tournament
                  as one of the top three run-getters. His natural leadership
                  skills caught the attention of all the right people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2008(June)</strong> - Still a teenager, Virat is
                  signed by IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore on a youth
                  contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2008(August)</strong> - Virat was called up to the
                  Indian ODI squad for the first time, playing all 5 matches in
                  an away series against Sri Lanka. He scored his first
                  half-century, an innings of 54, in game 4 of the series.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2009</strong> - Virat had to wait a while to get back
                  into the national team, but it was worth it when he scored his
                  maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2011</strong> - Virat played every single match of
                  India’s successful 2011 World Cup campaign, making his only
                  century in the first game of the tournament against
                  Bangladesh. Though he didn’t really light up the tournament
                  with his bat, his quote about Sachin at the end of the
                  tournament has gone down in cricketing folklore: “Sachin
                  Tendulkar has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years.
                  It is time we carried him on our shoulders.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2011</strong> - Ask any cricketer what their
                  aspiration is, and they will universally say play Test
                  cricket. Virat finally got the chance to make his Test debut
                  in 2011 against the West Indies, and unfortunately for the
                  charismatic youngster, it was a far-from-memorable occasion,
                  making a grand total of 19 runs in the two innings he played.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2012</strong> - Kohli scored his first test hundred in
                  rather spectacular circumstances in the fourth and final test
                  against Australia at Adelaide, narrowly surviving getting run
                  out when batting with Ishant Sharma, almost running out of
                  partners as well. His effort though failed to save India. We
                  lost the series 4-0.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2012</strong> - Virat played what is arguably one of
                  the best ODI innings ever by an Indian batsmen smashing 133
                  not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls to guide India to
                  the final of CB Series in Australia. India were chasing 321
                  and got to the target in 37 overs as Hobart witnessed one of
                  the greatest batting displays ever.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2013</strong> - Virat was named stand-in ODI skipper
                  for an injured MS Dhoni when India toured the West Indies;
                  earlier that year, he had also been appointed captain of his
                  IPL franchise, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2014</strong> - Kohli got his first taste of Test
                  captaincy when he was once again asked to step in for an
                  injured MS in Australia, and celebrated by scoring a century
                  in both innings in Adelaide. In what was a memorable
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2015</strong> - Having become a co-owner in ISL
                  football club FC Goa the previous year, Kohli extended his
                  interest to tennis by also picking up stake in the IPTL
                  franchise, UAE Royals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2016</strong> - He played what was easily the best
                  innings of his burgeoning career as India beat Australia in
                  Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of the ICC World T20. His
                  82 off 51 balls was a classy effort, etched with timing and
                  precision as opposed to the lappa style of cricket one usually
                  associates with 20 over cricket.
